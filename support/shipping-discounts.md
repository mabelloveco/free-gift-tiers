Free Gift Campaign: $50 threshold (Gift worth $15)
Free Shipping: $75 threshold

Result:
- Free gift added ‚úì
- Free shipping applied ‚úì
- Total savings: $15 + $8 = $23
```

**Scenario 2: Different Thresholds**
```
Cart: $60
Free Gift: $50 threshold ‚úì (qualifies)
Free Shipping: $75 threshold ‚úó (doesn't qualify)

Result:
- Free gift added ‚úì
- Shipping charged ($8)
```

### Configure Stacking
**Settings** ‚Üí **Campaign Stacking** ‚Üí **Shipping + Product**

Options:
- **Stack both** (default) - Maximum savings
- **Best value only** - Highest $ discount wins
- **Shipping priority** - Free shipping blocks other offers

```

**In Cart**:
- "You're $12 away from free shipping!"
- Progress bar showing proximity

**On Product Pages**:
- Banner: "Free Shipping on orders over $75"
- Add urgency: "Add one more item!"

**At Checkout**:
- Confirm free shipping applied
- Show $ saved

### 3. Test Different Thresholds
**A/B Test**:
- Group A: $50 threshold
- Group B: $75 threshold
- Group C: $100 threshold

**Measure**:
- Conversion rate
- Average order value
- Profit margin per order

### 4. Seasonal Adjustments
**Holiday Season**: Lower threshold to compete
**Slow Season**: Raise threshold to protect margins
**Flash Sales**: Temporary free shipping (no threshold)
