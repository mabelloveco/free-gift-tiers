## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

### Visual Emotion
- **Bold typography:** Large, confident headlines with tight letter-spacing
- **Generous whitespace:** Breathing room between all elements
- **Soft shadows:** Subtle elevation on hover (4-24px blur)
- **Gradient backgrounds:** Warm `#fef3f2` → `#fff5f0` transitions
- **Smooth motion:** 200ms ease on all interactions

### Color (Warm & Accessible)
- **Primary:** `#e85d37` (warm orange-red)
- **Accent gradient:** `#e85d37` → `#d84a28`
- **Text primary:** `#1a1a1a` (high contrast)
- **Text secondary:** `#6b6b6b` (WCAG AA compliant)
- **Background gradients:** Soft peach tones

### Imagery & Layout
- **Large hero:** Edge-to-edge warm gradient card
- **Icon accents:** Emoji icons for visual personality
- **Two-column layout:** 2/3 FAQ + 1/3 sticky chat
- **Card-based:** All content in rounded, shadowed cards

### Microcopy
- **Short, sensory:** "How can we help you today?"
- **No exclamations:** Calm, confident tone
- **Action verbs:** "Create", "Navigate", "Set", "Configure"
- **Clear instructions:** Step-by-step without clichés

### Motion
- **150-250ms duration:** Fast but not jarring
- **Ease timing:** Natural deceleration
- **Hover reveals:** Lift on cards (-2px), shadow increase
- **Message animations:** 200ms slide-in from bottom
- **No parallax:** Reserved for hero only (not applicable here)

### Accessibility
- **Focus states:** Visible 2px `#e85d37` outlines
- **Keyboard navigation:** Full support with proper tabbing
- **ARIA labels:** `aria-expanded` on collapsibles
- **Screen reader friendly:** Semantic HTML structure
- **Color contrast:** All text meets WCAG AA (4.5:1+)
- **16px base font:** Readable for all users
- **Reduced motion:** Respects user preferences

### Performance
- **No layout shift:** Proper height constraints
- **GPU transforms:** Only `translateY`, no `top`/`left`
- **Lazy reveals:** Animations only on interaction
- **No blocking scripts:** All JS async/deferred
- **Minimal CSS:** Single 250-line module
